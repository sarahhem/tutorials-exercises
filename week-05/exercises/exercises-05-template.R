# Week 5: Data Wrangling with dplyr - Part 2
# Estimated time: 45-60 minutes
#
# Learning goals:
# - summarize multiple variables with across()
# - count rows and sum existing counts with count()
# - create categories with case_when()
# - combine and filter related tables using keys and joins
# - clean strings and detect or extract text patterns
# - create date-times and extract date-time components
# - round values, distinguish logarithm bases, and order factor levels
# - combine these tools in a pipeline
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Write code below each question; keep the questions and instructions.
# 2. Use descriptive object names in snake_case.
# 3. Answer interpretation questions using comments (#).
# 4. Run your script from top to bottom before finishing.

# We will stick with using the penguins dataset from the
# {palmerpenguins} package for Parts 1-3. For Part 4, 
# we will use the data from the {nycflights13} package. For
# the remainder, we will create data.
	
	
# ============================================================
# Part 1: across() ####
# ============================================================
# 1. What are the median bill length, bill depth, and flipper length of penguins on each island?

# For each island, calculate the median bill_length_mm,
# bill_depth_mm, and flipper_length_mm using across().
# Ignore missing values. Name the columns with the original name
# followed by _median. Save the result as island_medians.

	island_medians <- penguins |>
	  group_by(island) |>
	  summarise(
	    across(
	      ends_with("_mm"),
	      ~ median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
	      .names = "{.col}_median")
	  )
	
	
	glimpse(island_medians)

	
# 2. What are the mean and standard deviation of bill length and body mass for female penguins of each species?

# Keep only female penguins. For each species, calculate
# the mean and standard deviation of bill_length_mm and body_mass_g.
# Use across() with a named list of functions and ignore missing values.
# Use names such as mean_bill_length_mm and sd_body_mass_g.
# Save the result as female_measurements.

	female_measurements <- penguins |>
	  filter(sex == "female") |>
	  group_by(species) |>
	  summarise(
	    across(
	      c(bill_length_mm, body_mass_g),
	      list(
	        mean = ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
	        sd = ~ sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE)
	      ),
	      .names = "{.fn}_{.col}"))
	  
	
	female_measurements
	
	

# ============================================================
# Part 2: count() ####
# ============================================================
# 3. How many penguin observations are there for each species in each year, considering only 2008 and 2009?

# Using one pipeline, keep observations from 2008 and 2009
# and count observations for each species-year combination.
# Save the result as species_year_counts.

	species_year_counts <- penguins |>
	  filter(year %in% c(2008, 2009)) |>
	  count(species, year)
	
	species_year_counts

# 4. Create a new summarized dataset that counts penguin observations for each combination of species and sex.
# Save as "penguin_counts".
	
# Hint: count penguin observations for each species-sex combination.
# Save the counts in a column called n_penguins.
# Each row in the resulting dataset represents one group,
# rather than one individual penguin.
# Missing sex values are included as a separate group.
	
	penguin_counts <- penguins |>
	  count(species, sex, name = "n_penguins")
	

# 5. How many penguins of each species are represented in penguin_counts? What would count(species) count if you omitted wt =?

# Hint: starting with penguin_counts, use count() with wt =
# to calculate the total number of penguins represented for each species.
# Save the result as species_totals.
# In a comment, explain what count(species) would count without wt =.

	species_totals <- penguin_counts |>
	  count(species, wt = n_penguins)

	species_totals
	# without wt = count(species) counts the species-sex combination of penguins
	# with wt = count(species) counts the total number

# ============================================================
# Part 3: case_when() ####
# ============================================================
# 6. Classify each penguin’s flipper length as short, medium, or long based on these thresholds:
# flipper_length_mm >= 210 -> "long"
# flipper_length_mm >= 190 and < 210 -> "medium"
# flipper_length_mm < 190 -> "short"
# Ensure you leave missing flipper lengths as missing categories and save the result as penguin_flipper_size.

	penguin_flipper_size <- penguins |>
	  mutate(
	    flipper_size = case_when(
	      flipper_length_mm >= 210 ~ "long",
	      flipper_length_mm >= 190 ~ "medium",
	      flipper_length_mm < 190 ~ "short",
	      .default = NA_character_))


# 7. How many penguins of each species fall into each flipper-size category? What does an NA in flipper_size mean?

# Starting with penguin_flipper_size, count observations
# by species and flipper_size. Save the result as flipper_counts.
# In a comment, explain what an NA in flipper_size means.

	flipper_counts <- penguin_flipper_size |>
	  count(species, flipper_size)
	
	flipper_counts
	
	# NA in flipper_size means that there is a missing variable in the flipper_size column  


# ============================================================
# Part 4: joins ####
# ============================================================

# Setup:
# We will use four datasets from {nycflights13}:
# - flights: one row per flight
# - airlines: airline codes (carrier) and full airline names (name)
# - airports: airport codes (faa) and airport names (name)
# - planes: information about aircraft, identified by tailnum
#
# Create a version of flights containing only the columns we need:

	flights_small <- flights |>
	  select(year, time_hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)


# 8. What airline operated each flight?
#
# Start with flights_small and join it to airlines.
# Match flights_small$carrier to airlines$carrier.
#
# Use left_join() to add the full airline name while keeping
# every flight. Explicitly specify the key with join_by().
# Save the result as flights_airlines.
#
# In a comment, identify the key and explain why the same carrier
# code can appear in multiple rows of flights_small.

	flights_airlines <- flights_small |>
	  left_join(airlines, join_by(carrier))
	
	glimpse(flights_airlines)
	
	# The key is carrier, because carriers can be on different flights ex: UA = united airlines, B6 = jet blue, carriers have several different flights


# 9. What is the full name of each flight's destination airport?
#
# Start with flights_small and join it to airports.
# Match flights_small$dest to airports$faa.
#
# First select faa and name from airports, renaming name
# to destination_name.
# Then use left_join() with join_by(dest == faa).
# Save the result as flights_destinations.
#
# In a comment, explain what an NA in destination_name means.

	flights_destinations <- flights_small |>
	  left_join(
	    airports |>
	      select(faa, destination_name = name),
	    join_by(dest == faa)
	  )
	
	glimpse(flights_destinations)

# NA in destination_name means the destination for that flight is a missing variable
	
#### The next two questions use a filtering join. ####
	
# 10. Which airlines operated flights in flights_small?
#
# Start with airlines and join it to flights_small.
# Match airlines$carrier to flights_small$carrier.
#
# Use semi_join() to keep only rows of airlines that have
# a matching carrier code in flights_small.
# Explicitly specify the key with join_by().
# Save the result as airlines_used.
#
# In a comment, explain whether semi_join() adds flight columns.

	airlines_used <- airlines |>
	  semi_join(flights_small, join_by(carrier))
	
	airlines_used
	
	# semi_join shows in airlines_used only the carrier and the full name of the carrier

# 11. Which aircraft identifiers in flights_small are missing
# from the planes dataset?
#
# Start with flights_small and remove rows with missing tailnum.
# Then join it to planes.
# Match flights_small$tailnum to planes$tailnum.
#
# Use anti_join() to keep flights whose tailnum has no match
# in planes. Explicitly specify the key with join_by().
# Finally, use distinct(tailnum) to keep each unmatched
# identifier only once.
# Save the result as unmatched_tail_numbers.

	unmatched_tail_numbers <- flights_small |>
	  filter(!is.na(tailnum)) |>
	  anti_join(planes, join_by(tailnum)) |>
	  distinct(tailnum)
	
	unmatched_tail_numbers

# 12. Starting with fish_records, use one mutate() to:
# a. remove leading and trailing whitespace from species with str_trim()
# b. convert species to title case with str_to_title()
# c. create a column called `state` from the first two characters of sample_id with str_sub()
# Save the result as fish_clean.

	fish_clean <- fish_records |>

	shark_records <- fish_clean |>
	  mutate(contains_shark = str_detect(species, "Shark")) |>
	  filter(contains_shark)


# ============================================================
# Part 6: regular expressions ####
# ============================================================

# 14. Starting with fish_clean, keep rows whose sample_id
# begins with either DE or NJ. Use filter() and str_detect().
# Save the result as de_nj_records.
# Hint: ^ marks the start of a string; | means OR.
# Make sure both alternatives are anchored to the beginning.

	de_nj_records <- fish_clean |>
	  filter(str_detect(sample_id, "^DE|^NJ"))
	
	de_nj_records
	

# 15. Starting with fish_clean, extract the numeric portion
# of sample_id into a new column called sample_number using str_extract().
# Save the result as fish_numbers.
# Hint: [0-9]+ means one or more digits.

# ============================================================
# Part 7: dates and times ####
# ============================================================


# 16. Starting with sampling_times (code below), use one mutate() to:
# a. convert datetime with ymd_hms(); times are in America/New_York
# b. create a new column `year` from datetime
# c. create a new column `month` with month(..., label = TRUE)
# d. create a new column `hour` from datetime
# Save the result as sampling_times_clean.

	    year = year(datetime),
	    month = month(datetime, label = TRUE),
	    hour = hour(datetime))


# 17. Starting with sampling_dates (code for dataframe below), create sample_date from
# year, month, and day using make_date(). Save as sampling_dates_clean.
# Check the class of sample_date. In a comment, explain how it differs
# from the datetime column in sampling_times_clean.

	sampling_dates <- tibble(
	  year = c(2025, 2026, 2026),

# ============================================================
# Part 8: rounding, logarithms, and factors
# ============================================================

# 18. We will go back to palmerpenguins::penguins for this question. 
# Calculate mean penguin body mass in kilograms, ignoring
# missing values, and round it to two decimal places.
# Save the number as mean_body_mass_kg.
	
	mean_body_mass_kg <- round(
	  mean(penguins$body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000,
	  digits = 2
	)


# 19. Calculate log(100) and log10(100).
# In comments: Are the results the same? What base does each use?

	log(100)
	log10(100)
	
	#log(100) = 4.60517 uses natural log base e
	#log10(100) = 2 uses base 10

# ============================================================
# Factor levels
# ============================================================

# Please read the following vector into R:
	size_class <- c("medium", "small", "large", "small", "medium", "large")

# 20. Convert size_class to a factor with levels in this order:
# small, medium, large. Save it as size_class_factor.
